Given an array of numbers from 1-9:

[4, 2, 5, 3, 9, 7, 1, 8, 2, 6];
Sort the array from lowest value to highest.

1. Go through items of given array one after another
2. Compare items on position 0 with item on position one
3. Item which is smaller compare with next one 
4. Find the smallest item
5. Push the smallest item in an empty array on position 0 and delete this one from original array.
6. Do again steps 2- 5 until original array not will be empty*/

Given an array of names: ["Fran", "Leon", "Ale", "Jenna", "Bleda", "Hadi"];
Sort the array based on alphabetical order from aâ†’ z.

6. One is smaller compare with first letter index of next word
7. If some items have the same index of first letter continue compare indexes of second letters
8. When one is left push it an empty array
